Ultimate android app template

<h1>What it contains:</h1>

- App news system. Just add a html file somewhere on a webserver. The app checks each time is started (if internet is present)
- Splash screen with the app news
- A custom listview and an edit text that filters the listview each time a character is written
- Info page with contact by email for feedback / Settings Page with some dummy settings
- Menu with everything you need: from share to settings 
- App checks if user rate it and promts for rating.
- A nice library with (maybe) useful stuff like checking free memory, setting custom font for all the activity etc. etc.

Build with IntelliJStudio
